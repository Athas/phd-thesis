\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusions}

We have presented a fully automatic optimizing compiler for Futhark, a
pure functional array language.  In particular, we have demonstrated
(i) how to support in-place updates in Futhark's type system, (ii) how
second-order array combinators can express symbolically both all
available parallelism and efficient sequentialization alternatives,
and (iii) how to fuse the program aggressively and then how to
decompose it yet again into kernels in a manner that can improve the
amount of efficient (common-case) parallelism.

We have validated our approach on $21$ benchmark programs, which are
compiled to GPU code via OpenCL. Compared to reference
implementations, the performance ranges from $\times0.21$ slowdown to
$\times13$ speedup, and is competitive on average.

Our results show that while the ease of high-level structural
transformation permitted by a functional language is powerful,
attention must still be paid to low-level issues such as communication
costs and memory access patterns.

We have made the developed compiler and all benchmark programs freely
available for reproduction, study, or further development.
