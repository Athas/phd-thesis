\section{Acknowledgements}

Language design and compiler hacking easily becomes a lonely
endeavour.  I would in particular like to thank Cosmin Oancea, Martin
Elsman, and Fritz Henglein for being willing to frequently and
vigorously discuss language design issues.  I am also grateful to all
students who contributed to the design and implementation of Futhark.
In no particular order: Niels G. W. Serup, Chi Pham, Maya Saietz,
Daniel Gavin, Hjalte Abelskov, Mikkel Storgaard Knudsen, Jonathan
Schrøder Holm Hansen, Sune Hellfritzsch, Christian Hansen, Lasse
Halberg Haarbye, Brian Spiegelhauer, William Sprent, René Løwe
Jacobsen, Anna Sofie Kiehn, Henrik Urms, and Rasmus Wriedt Larsen.
Development of the compiler was aided by the Giuseppe Bilotta's advice
on OpenCL programming, and James Price's work on
\texttt{oclgrind}~\cite{price2015oclgrind}.

And of course, I am grateful that Lea was able to put up with me for
these three and a half years, even if I still do not understand why.
